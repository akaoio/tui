# Agent: Claude Session 5 - FINAL PUSH to 100% Coverage

## Mission: Đạt 100% Test Coverage cho @tui/ framework

## Current Situation Analysis:
- Framework test đã được xây dựng qua 4 sessions
- Method-level testing patterns đã established  
- Một số tests pass, một số fail do implementation mismatches
- Cần focused approach để đạt target 100%

## Strategy for 100% Coverage:

### Phase 1: Coverage Analysis & Gap Identification
1. Run detailed coverage report
2. Identify uncovered files/methods
3. Prioritize high-impact areas

### Phase 2: Fix & Optimize Existing Tests  
1. Fix failing tests with implementation mismatches
2. Ensure all existing tests pass reliably
3. Optimize for maximum coverage gain

### Phase 3: Systematic Gap Filling
1. Test every method file individually  
2. Cover all branches (if/else, try/catch)
3. Add edge case testing

### Phase 4: Final Validation
1. Verify 100% coverage achieved
2. Performance check
3. Documentation update
