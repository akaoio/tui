# 📊 TEST COVERAGE REPORT - TUI Framework

**Date**: 2025-08-21  
**Agent**: Claude Session 2  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Need team collaboration

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Achieve 100% test coverage for refactored TUI framework với new Class = Directory + Method-per-file architecture.

---

## ✅ COMPLETED WORK

### 1. Fixed ALL TypeScript Errors
- **191 → 0 errors** 
- Build thành công 100% (CJS, ESM, DTS)
- All method files có proper `this: any` typing

### 2. Created Comprehensive Test Suites
- `new-architecture.test.ts` - Testing core classes với method delegation
- `components-new.test.ts` - All refactored components 
- `utils.test.ts` - Utility functions coverage
- `method-files.test.ts` - Direct testing của individual method files

### 3. Test Strategy Developed
```
Class (Container) → Method Files → Individual Testing
     ↓                    ↓              ↓
  Integration        Unit Tests     Coverage
```

## 📈 COVERAGE PROGRESS

### Current Coverage: ~17-20%
- Challenges với new architecture
- Old tests incompatible với method delegation pattern
- Need comprehensive refactoring

### Files Needing Coverage:
1. **Core Classes** (0% coverage)
   - TUI.ts
   - App.ts
   - Component.ts
   - VirtualCursor system
   
2. **Method Files** (partial coverage)
   - 200+ method files cần individual tests
   - Each method cần isolated testing
   
3. **Utils** (partial coverage)
   - platform.ts (0%)
   - services.ts (0%)
   - Some style utilities

---

## 🚧 CHALLENGES

### 1. Architecture Mismatch
- Old tests expect monolithic classes
- New architecture uses method delegation
- Mock setup needs complete overhaul

### 2. Scale of Work
- **200+ method files** to test individually
- Each class split into 5-20 methods
- Need both unit AND integration tests

### 3. Testing Pattern
```javascript
// Old Pattern (Monolithic)
class.method() // Direct call

// New Pattern (Delegation)
class.method() → method.call(this) → actual logic
```

## 🤝 TEAM COLLABORATION NEEDED

### Task Distribution Suggestion:

#### Agent 1: Core Classes Testing
- Focus on TUI, App, Component base classes
- Test class instantiation và method delegation
- Mock setup for core functionality

#### Agent 2: Component Testing
- Test all Input, Select, Checkbox, etc.
- Both container classes và method files
- UI component behavior testing

#### Agent 3: Utility & Helper Testing  
- Platform utilities
- Service managers
- Color/style functions
- Helper methods

#### Agent 4: Integration Testing
- End-to-end testing
- Example apps testing
- Schema-driven UI testing

## 🛠️ TESTING APPROACH

### 1. Method File Testing Template
```javascript
describe('MethodName', () => {
  let mockContext;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockContext = {
      // Mock properties
    };
  });
  
  test('should perform expected behavior', () => {
    methodName.call(mockContext, args);
    expect(mockContext.property).toBe(expected);
  });
});
```

### 2. Container Class Testing Template
```javascript
describe('ClassName', () => {
  test('should delegate method correctly', () => {
    const instance = new ClassName();
    const spy = jest.spyOn(methodFile, 'methodName');
    
    instance.method();
    expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
  });
});
```

## 📊 METRICS

### Files to Test:
- **15+ Container Classes**
- **200+ Method Files**
- **50+ Utility Functions**
- **Total**: ~300+ test targets

### Estimated Effort:
- **Per method file**: 3-5 tests
- **Per container**: 5-10 tests
- **Total tests needed**: 1000-1500 tests

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Parallelize Testing Work**
   - Multiple agents work on different modules
   - Share test patterns và templates
   - Coordinate through teamwork/

2. **Use Test Generators**
   - Create script to generate boilerplate tests
   - Auto-detect method files và generate stubs
   - Focus on logic, not boilerplate

3. **Progressive Coverage**
   - Start với core functionality
   - Move to components
   - End với utilities
   - Ensure each merge maintains green tests

4. **Mock Strategy**
   - Create shared mock factories
   - Reuse context mocks across tests
   - Document mock patterns

## 📝 NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT

### What Works:
- Build is 100% successful
- Framework is functional
- Basic test structure established

### What Needs Work:
- Coverage is only 17-20%
- Many method files untested
- Integration tests needed

### Suggested Next Steps:
1. Pick a module (e.g., Input, Select)
2. Write tests for ALL its method files
3. Achieve 100% coverage for that module
4. Move to next module
5. Repeat until 100% overall

---

**IMPORTANT**: Framework WORKS và BUILD PASSES. Focus là achieving test coverage, không phải fixing functionality.

Good luck team! Let's achieve 100% coverage together! 🎯💪
