### Responsive Design Patterns

```typescript
// Service status adaptation
if (isMobile) {
  display = `${service.icon} ${statusIcon} ${service.name}`;
  details = `${uptime} ‚Ä¢ ${requests} req`;
} else {
  display = `${service.icon} ${statusIcon} ${service.name} | Uptime: ${uptime} | Requests: ${requests} | Errors: ${errors}`;
}
```

```typescript
// Navigation adaptation  
if (isMobile) {
  // Two-row navigation with abbreviations
  row1 = "[1]Over [2]Comp [3]Test [4]Build";
  row2 = "[5]P2P [6]Acts [7]Logs";
} else {
  // Single-row navigation with full names
  nav = "[1] Overview [2] Composer [3] Battle [4] Builder [5] Air [6] Quick Actions [7] System Logs";
}
```

## Advanced Features

### Service Health Monitoring
```typescript
interface ServiceStatus {
  name: string;
  status: 'running' | 'stopped' | 'error' | 'starting';
  health: 'healthy' | 'warning' | 'critical' | 'unknown';
  metrics: {
    uptime?: number;      // Service uptime in seconds
    cpu?: number;         // CPU usage percentage
    memory?: number;      // Memory usage percentage  
    requests?: number;    // Total request count
    errors?: number;      // Error count
  };
}
```

### Real-Time Metrics Collection
- **Automatic Health Checks**: Periodic service status verification
- **Performance Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and response time tracking
- **Error Rate Analysis**: Automated error detection and categorization
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical performance data and prediction

### Cross-Service Workflow Automation
```typescript
// Example: Automated build and test workflow
async function executeFullPipeline() {
  await executeAction('Clean Build');        // Builder
  await executeAction('Build Documentation'); // Composer  
  await executeAction('Run All Tests');       // Battle
  await executeAction('Sync Network Data');   // Air
}
```

### Process Management
- **Background Execution**: Non-blocking operation execution
- **Process Lifecycle**: Start, monitor, stop, restart capabilities
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory and CPU usage tracking
- **Automatic Recovery**: Service restart on failure

## Integration Architecture

### Service Discovery
```typescript
// Automatic service detection and registration
private async discoverServices(): Promise<ServiceStatus[]> {
  const services = [];
  
  // Check for @akaoio/composer
  if (await this.checkComposerAvailable()) {
    services.push(this.createComposerService());
  }
  
  // Check for @akaoio/battle  
  if (await this.checkBattleAvailable()) {
    services.push(this.createBattleService());
  }
  
  // Additional service discovery...
  return services;
}
```

### Inter-Service Communication
```typescript
// Cross-service coordination
interface ServiceMessage {
  from: string;      // Source service
  to: string;        // Target service  
  type: string;      // Message type
  payload: any;      // Message data
  timestamp: number; // Message timestamp
}
```

### Configuration Management
```typescript
// Unified configuration across services
interface DashboardConfig {
  refreshInterval: number;        // Auto-refresh timing
  enabledServices: string[];      // Active service list
  quickActions: QuickAction[];    // Available quick actions
  logRetention: number;           // Log history size
  mobileOptimizations: boolean;   // Mobile-specific features
}
```
